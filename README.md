# Screen Guardian

Screen Guardian is a web application that demonstrates real-time content monitoring and blocking using AI. It simulates a system service that protects users from harmful text by analyzing on-screen content and displaying an overlay when objectionable material is detected.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Real-Time Content Analysis:** Type or paste text into the simulator to see it analyzed in real-time.
- **AI-Powered Smart Analysis:** Leverages Google's Gemini model via Genkit to intelligently categorize harmful content (e.g., Hate Speech, Violence) and explain *why* it was flagged.
- **Dynamic Blocking Overlay:** When harmful content is detected, a non-intrusive overlay appears, blocking the content and showing the analysis results.
- **Activity Dashboard:** A comprehensive dashboard that visualizes blocked content categories with a bar chart and lists recent blocking events in a detailed log.
- **Permission-Based Simulation:** Simulates the process of granting necessary system permissions (like Accessibility and Overlay) required for such an app to function on a real device.
- **Local History:** All blocking activity is saved in the browser's local storage for persistence across sessions.
- **Simulated Pro Features:** Includes a demonstration of "Pro" features like a custom blocklist to show how a Freemium monetization model could be implemented.

## ü§î How It Works: A Web-Based Simulation

This project is a **web-based simulation** of a native desktop or mobile application. It demonstrates the core logic and user interface of Screen Guardian in a browser environment.

1.  **Simulated Permissions:** The user first "enables" simulated permissions for accessibility and overlay drawing. In a real app, these would be actual system-level requests.
2.  **Manual Text Input:** On the main page, the user manually types or pastes text into a textarea to trigger the analysis.
3.  **Debounced Check:** As the user types, the input is debounced. A local check is performed against a blocklist to see if a more expensive AI analysis is warranted.
4.  **AI Analysis:** If a potential match is found, the text is sent to a Next.js Server Action (`checkContent`).
5.  **Genkit Flow:** The server action invokes the `contentAnalysisFlow`. This flow sends the text to the Gemini API, asking for a classification and reason.
6.  **Response & UI Update:** The AI's analysis is returned to the client. If the content is flagged (`isObjectionable: true`), the `BlockingOverlay` component is displayed over the textarea.
7.  **History Logging:** Every time content is blocked, the event details are saved to the browser's local storage.
8.  **Dashboard:** The `/dashboard` page reads the history from local storage to render the activity charts and logs.

### üí° Real-World Application Concept

In a real-world scenario, Screen Guardian would not be a website. It would be a **native application** installed on your operating system (e.g., Windows, macOS, Android). Here‚Äôs how it would function:

-   **Background Service:** After being granted actual **Accessibility and Overlay permissions** by the OS, the app would run as a quiet background service.
-   **System-Wide Monitoring:** It would automatically and passively monitor the text that appears on your screen in *any application*‚Äîwhether it's a web browser, a chat client, or a document editor.
-   **Instantaneous Blocking:** When harmful content is detected, the app would instantly draw the **Blocking Overlay** directly on top of the content, preventing you from seeing it, without you needing to do anything.
-   **Control Panel:** The interface you see in this web simulation would serve as the app's **control panel** or **settings dashboard**, where you could manage your subscription, customize the blocklist, and view the activity log.

## API and Function Reference

This section provides a detailed breakdown of the key functions, components, and APIs used throughout the Screen Guardian application.

### Frontend Components & Hooks

#### `src/app/page.tsx` - Main Application Page

This is the primary user-facing component for content analysis.

| Function / Hook        | Description                                                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ScreenGuardianPage()` | The main functional component. Manages state for permissions, user input text, and AI analysis results.                                                                 |
| `handlePermissionToggle(permission)` | Toggles the state of a given permission (`accessibility` or `overlay`), updates `localStorage`, and shows a confirmation toast.                                 |
| `handleClear()`        | Resets the application state by clearing the text area content and the previous analysis result.                                                                          |
| `handleTextChange(e)`  | Triggered on text area input. It debounces the input, performs a quick local check against a blocklist, and if a potential match is found, calls the `checkContent` server action. |
| `useEffect()`          | On initial component mount, it loads permission states from `localStorage` and fetches the `blocked-words.json` blocklist.                                             |
| `useMemo()`            | Used to derive `allPermissionsGranted` and `isBlocking` states from component state, optimizing re-renders.                                                              |
| `renderPermissionsSetup()` | A function that returns the JSX for the initial permission setup card.                                                                                              |
| `renderMonitoringInterface()` | A function that returns the JSX for the main content monitoring interface, including the text area and blocking overlay.                                            |

---

#### `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Activity Dashboard

This component displays analytics about blocked content.

| Function / Hook   | Description                                                                                                    |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DashboardPage()` | The main functional component for the dashboard. Fetches and displays data from `localStorage`.                |
| `clearHistory()`  | Clears the `blockingHistory` item from `localStorage` and resets the component's state.                          |
| `useEffect()`     | On mount, sets a flag `isClient` to `true` to avoid server-side rendering issues with `localStorage`. It then loads the history. |
| `useMemo()`       | Used to calculate `chartData` (aggregating counts per category) and `sortedHistory` from the history state. This avoids re-calculating on every render. |

---

#### `src/components/blocking-overlay.tsx` - Blocking Overlay

A reusable component that appears over the UI to block content.

| Prop      | Type                  | Description                                                              |
| --------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `result`  | `ContentAnalysis` \| `null` | The analysis result from the AI. The overlay is shown if `result.isObjectionable` is `true`. |
| `onClear` | `() => void`          | A callback function that is invoked when the "Clear and Continue" button is clicked. |

---

### Backend (Server Actions & AI Flows)

#### `src/app/actions.ts` - Server Actions

These are functions that run exclusively on the server but can be called directly from client components.

| Function           | Parameters       | Returns                 | Description                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `checkContent()`   | `text: string`   | `Promise<ContentAnalysis>` | The primary server action. It validates the input text and calls the `analyzeContent` Genkit flow to perform AI analysis. Includes error handling for AI service failures. |

---

#### `src/ai/flows/content-check.ts` - Genkit AI Flow

This file defines the core AI logic for content analysis.

| Function / Definition       | Description                                                                                                                                                               |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ContentAnalysisSchema`     | A `zod` schema that defines the expected structure of the JSON output from the AI model. It ensures type safety for the AI's response.                                       |
| `analyzeContent(text)`      | The exported wrapper function that the server action calls. It invokes the `contentAnalysisFlow` with the provided text and returns the result.                             |
| `contentAnalysisFlow`       | The main Genkit flow, defined with `ai.defineFlow`. It orchestrates the AI call by taking a string input, passing it to the prompt, and returning the structured output.     |
| `contentAnalysisPrompt`     | A Genkit prompt definition, created with `ai.definePrompt`. It contains the actual instruction string sent to the Gemini model and specifies the input and output schemas. |
