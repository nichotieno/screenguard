# Real-World Application Concept

In the real world, Screen Guardian would be a native desktop or mobile application that you install directly on your device. Here's how it would work:

- **Installation & Permissions:** A user would download and install the app. Upon first launch, it would ask for actual system permissions (like "Accessibility" and "Draw over other apps"). These are the real versions of the permissions we've been simulating.
- **Runs in the Background:** Once set up, the app would run as a quiet background service. It wouldn't need to be open in a window.
- **Automatic, System-Wide Monitoring:** Using the Accessibility service, it would automatically monitor text as it appears in any application on the user's screenâ€”a web browser, a chat app, a document, etc. The user would not have to copy and paste anything.
- **Instant Blocking:** The moment objectionable content is detected, the app would instantly display the blocking overlay directly on top of it, no matter which app it's in.
